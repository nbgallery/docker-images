This repository contains Jupyter docker images developed by the [nbgallery](https://github.com/nbgallery) project.  A brief description is below; please see the README in each directory for more information.

  * [nbgallery/base-notebook](base-notebook): This is the base image that we use in production deployments with the [nbgallery](https://github.com/nbgallery/nbgallery) notebook collaboration platform.

The image contains Jupyter [extensions](https://github.com/nbgallery/nbgallery-extensions) to [integrate](https://github.com/nbgallery/nbgallery/blob/master/docs/jupyter_integration.md) with the nbgallery.
